## GSA DevOps Presentation

Good [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1753&v=slsAzknseTg) on the work Booze Allen Hamilton is doing at the GSA on their Integrated Aquisition Environment.

Tools they are using that I need to read about:

- [Keywhiz](https://square.github.io/keywhiz/)
- [Conduit](https://github.com/ehazlett/conduit)
- [Interlock](https://github.com/ehazlett/interlock)
- [API Umbrella](http://apiumbrella.io/)
